      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        OHC promote health by creating highly usable and useful digital services for healthcare professionals and patients.
      </p>
      <p>
        We build tools for doctors that focus on usability and solving the problems of people on the front line.
      </p>
      <p>
        By building applications that help front-line medical staff to work smarter, we smooth the rough edges of patient care, letting people spend more time healing the sick and less time grappling with the system.
      </p>
      <P>
        High quality universal health care is the destination
        It's about doing the right thing in the right way or...
        Clinical effectiveness, patient safety, and patient experience.

      <h2>Our Strategy</h2>

      <p>
        Digital as a medium is special. Healthcare is an information
        business. There's a huge opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can watch and learn from user behaviour, shaping the system to discover and meet user needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is immense potential for creativity, flexibility, and sharing.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can profit from economies of scale, adding value and reducing costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it needs to be done right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Develop procurement ability, procurement influence for those
        with a deep understanding of technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Employ (good) software developers directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scientific software development, open governance + open
        source (enlightenment principles, can't own all the talent,
        profit from plurality of motivation)
      </p>
      <p>
        Adopt modern software design principles, user focus, test,
        learn, and adapt.

      <p>
        David was born at a very young age. Sometime after that he studied Philosophy,
        before deciding not to worry so much about the meaning of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unrelated to this, he later became a software engineer, where serendipitously enough,
        it turned out that having strong opinions about truthiness, and the logical consistency
        of concepts could actually be of practical use.

      </p>
      <p>
She spend a lot of free time being told to stand up straight in flamenco classes and believes everyone should do yoga so we can still stand on our heads when we get old and absorb a chilled out view of the world... except when playing Wipeout on the Playstation.
