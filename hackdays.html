        <h2>Hackdays</h2>
        <p>
          Technology is changing the world, and our expectations.
          Corporate IT is lagging behind personal IT
        </p>
        <p>
          The NHS can't afford to lag behind
        </p>
        <p>
          The world is becoming more digital and so is health
          <br />
          The medium used to support, and deliver health, matters
          <br />
          The medium should be digital but we must do it right
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that innovation happens when you give people freedom.
          <br />
          Which is why we run Hack Days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hack Days are all about intensive collaboration. They allow you to sidestep the bureaucracy that
          slows down innovation, and rapidly realise fresh ideas. When you bring together multidisciplinary
          domain experts and inspire them, amazing things happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Hack Days last just a couple days, but what you get from that time is extraordinary.
          The intense focus towards a common goal turns ideas into reality before more traditional methods
          would be done deciding whether it was a good idea.
