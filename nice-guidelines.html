        <h2>Nice Guidelines App</h2>
        <p>
          NICE quality standards are a set of specific, concise statements that act as markers of high quality,
          cost effective patient care, covering the treatment and prevention of different diseases and conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This app provides a fast and convenient means to access, download, and view these guidelines
          (available at http://www.nice.org.uk/)
        </p>
        <p>
          It links to the latest NICE Clinical Guidelines and opens them using your preferred PDF Viewer.
        </p>
        <p>
          These guidelines will be cached on the phone/tablet on first use or you can download them in advance
          - WiFi is advised for this but not enforced.

          Great for use in areas where reception is poor or you can't get to a PC.
