          Open Prescribing offers an API and an interactive data exploration tool that allows clinicians, researchers, journalists, & even members of the public to discover what's going on with drug prescriptions in the UK
        </p>
        <p>
          For many conditions prescription drugs are the mainstay of treatment and their use is intimately related to health outcomes for patients. Analysis of open GP Prescribing Data suggests considerable variation in prescribing behaviour. Sometimes this may be justified by true variation in patient groups; but often it reflects unwarranted variation in care. This data therefore presents an opportunity to support prescribers and optimise health outcomes for patients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Support of prescribers may be direct and educational. For example a GP may enter his practice details and see that his practice is an outlier for the prescription of a certain class of drugs and decide to refresh his or her knowledge in this areas through a targeted educational module. Integration with an electronic prescribing system to provide personalised feedback, based on actual practice, would also be possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively prescribers may be supported indirectly by open prescribing, for example by open prescribing supporting health service research areas such as prescribing policy impact evaluation.

          Hack Days are all about intensive collaboration. They allow you to sidestep the bureaucracy that
          slows down innovation, and rapidly realise fresh ideas. When you bring together multidisciplinary
          domain experts and inspire them, amazing things happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Hack Days last just a couple days, but what you get from that time is extraordinary.
          The intense focus towards a common goal turns ideas into reality before more traditional methods
          would be done deciding whether it was a good idea.
